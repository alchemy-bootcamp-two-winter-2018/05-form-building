# Kilovolt Blog: Now With Forms!

**Author**: Keli
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
An example of how a blog might be coded using a front-end only approach. Created as an assignment for Alchemy Code Lab's Bootcamp II.

## Getting Started
Currently, the blog can only be viewed by cloning to your own machine and opening the HTML files in a browswer (ideally, Chrome).

## Architecture
The blog uses HTML, CSS, and JS along with jQuery and Handlebars.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
